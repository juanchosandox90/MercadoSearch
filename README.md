The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android
application architecture that is modular, scalable, and maintainable. This application may look simple, but it
has all of these small details that will set the rock-solid foundation of the larger app suitable for bigger teams and
long application lifecycle management.

This app allows you to find and see information about products exposed on the marketplace of Mercado Libre. You can see information about prices, shipping, condition 
and also you can take a look at the product on the official store.
